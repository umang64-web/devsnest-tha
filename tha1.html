    <h3>Subject:- 30 days devsnest program</h3>
    <p>Dear Mr.Ak Garg</p>
    <p style="font-family:  'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif"  >This letter is to inform you about the
        devsnest's 30 day training program.
        This program helps the students to learn in a responsive environment where they can 
        grow individualy as well as a group. The  program includes some of the best handpicked
        questions that have been asked in FANG interviews and other companies as well. The program
        focuses on a strong DSA foundation and also provides a development environment for the students to make
        mistakes and learn together. Please schedule a meeting so that we can take the talk further
        
      <p>Waiting for your positive response</p></p>
      <br>
   <p style="font-style: italic;">
    Your Sincerely<br>
    Umang Aggarwal<br>
    Devsnest Member<br>
